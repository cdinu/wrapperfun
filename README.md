# wrapperfun

simulate we have to wrap a sklearn function from some python package that some other dev wrote in Python. 

just do a `virtualenv`, `pip install flask`, and have fun running `python web3.py`
test with `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/kaa/sample_event` or by visiting the link with a browser.


in `jsclient` there is a sample on how to call the function from nodejs.
